So ive bought a laptop but idk if i got a good deal for it,"So basically my university is starting soon and i bought a second hand laptop. I wanted one that could run most softwares as well as medium req games.
I settled for a dell precision 5510
Specs:
I5-6th gen quad core
16gb ram ddr4
512 ssd no nvme
Nvidia quadro M1000M 2 gb

I got it for 73500

Ive noticed a glaring issue that the vent is at the bottom and hence the laptop heats up really quickly.
I was wondering if its a bad decision to hold onto the laptopand wether i got it for a good price.",2024-09-06 08:58:54,CodeNameNajam_og,1,False,"**Reminder:** Please be courteous to each other and report any violations of the subreddit rules.

Looking for a guy I lost on Muzz - Saad - Karachi. ,"Hi, 

This is for you Saad - if in case you're in this community. We spoke around Bakra Eid on Muzz, and you told me very honestly in the first conversation about your health, and I told you lets get to know each other and Ill do istikharah. 

To remind you, I am tha ACCA fella, in Dubai, from Karachi, I told you I live with my Dad in Dxb and you told me you'd be visiting soon around December and that I show you around..I told you my mom lives in Johar as well and your mom can meet her. 

I was having some issues and had closed Muzz, however now that I logged back in to rematch with you, it seems you have deleted your account. Though we only talked twice. I think we had similarities and perhaps we can work things out. 

If you resonate, please reach out. ",2024-09-06 08:45:29,No_Leopard_5183,1,False,"**Reminder:** Please be courteous to each other and report any violations of the subreddit rules.
