Firewall Failed in Pakistan because....,"Firewall Failed in Pakistan because they had to arrest Aun Ali Khosa in the middle of night and probably forced him to delete Bill Bill Pakistan.
If the firewall was working they could have put that link in block list or something.

He just  highlighted the issue of high electricity bills. The video mysteriously disappeared from his channel following his detention, raising further suspicions about the motive behind his abduction.

Aun Ali Khosa is widely known for his humorous videos and satire on political and social matters. His sudden disappearance has left many questioning the state of free expression in the country.

One of my students is about to be married off and sent to Pakistan,"I tutor Math and Physics students in Ontario. One of my students is a girl of Pakistani background, really smart, grasps concepts quickly. She's been my student for a year and a half now. Last weekend I was discussing timings with her mom, we discussed how good her progress has been, and I asked what her top choice of universities is. She told me she's going to go to Pakistan to marry a relative, so they weren't looking into universities.

I held my tongue at the time but the more I think about it the more agitated I've been getting. Shes a bright girl with good grades. I'm not saying she's being forced into this (but considering her age I feel it's not crazy to assume a certain degree of coercion). It just made me incredibly sad.",2024-08-16 15:01:14,insafian,373,False,Pakistanis can't think about anything beyond marriage...,"Have a private talk with the girl and ask what she wants.

However the other person was correct to highlight that they do in fact have plenty of female interaction in their villages as there r women working at the farms and brick kilns in the villages. Yet they dare not publicly harass them as they know they would be lynched and shunned by the villagers.

I have had to block all emails from Pakistan thanks to a  cyber harassment operation, no doubt instigated by PTIâ€™s desperate opponents. Obviously as Twitter/ X  is now banned in Pakistan by said desperate opponents, only those with VPNs will see this.

North Waziristan - Punjab Gas Pipeline removed by the orders of Utmanzai Jirga and other tribals,"About a year ago, gas was discovered in North Waziristan. However, despite a year of negotiations and discussions, the government has not prioritized providing gas to the local population. Instead, theyâ€™ve focused on transporting it to Punjab.
The Otmanzai Jirga, led by Malik Nasrullah Khan Wazir, has been in talks with the government for the past year, advocating for the rights of the locals to have access to the gas first. Unfortunately, these efforts have been ignored, and the government has made no progress in supplying gas to the residents of Waziristan.
The people of North Waziristan have taken matters into their own hands. Theyâ€™ve begun removing the gas pipeline that was meant to transport gas from Waziristan to Punjab. The message is clear: no gas will leave Waziristan until the local people receive their fair share.",2024-08-16 11:40:06,drunkhan,191,False,"Completely agreed. It's oppressive to extract a resource from some people's land and not give them access to it. Every Waziristani should get it before a cubic inch of it reaches Punjab.

It's because of stuff like this that TTP, PTM, BLA, BLF, and other groups consider Pakistan to be Punjabistan and the Pakistan Army to be a Punjabi Army.
