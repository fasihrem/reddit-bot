Versatile Composer seeking paid work so I can continue to pay my bills on time,,2024-08-16 08:35:17,Mouthless,1,False,"I'm Louis, a professional, versatile composer and sound designer based in the UK, looking to contribute my skills to your upcoming projects. It’s been quite a slow year for me and I would really appreciate any offers for work.

I tend to work mostly on horrors and documentaries, but I genuinely have a broad skillset and can contribute to films of any style, given the right direction. 

I'm a great communicator, collaborator and negotiator. I take my work seriously and aim to give you the best possible experience of working together. I work from my home studio, using my large collection of software synths, sample libraries, real instruments and hardware.

If you would like to discuss the possibility of working together then please drop me a message on here or email me at [mouthless@hotmail.co.uk](mailto:mouthless@hotmail.co.uk)

If you're not interested but you’ve read this far anyway, then I'd appreciate any feedback you can offer about my reel, my website, or my pitch. I very recently updated the ‘about me’ section on my website based on some constructive feedback on one of my previous posts, so I do really appreciate any engagement and take feedback into consideration.

I am particularly looking for regular collaborators (if and where possible) but one-off projects are always welcome too. If you don’t have any projects currently in progress, then please still feel free to reach out to discuss anything you might be planning for the future.

For more examples of my work and many positive testimonials, please see my website: [https://louispalfrey.com/](https://louispalfrey.com/)

My rates are flexible and I will always do my best to negotiate to find a way to work within your budget.

I’m Autistic, and I embrace my Neurodivergence with pride. My unique perspective combined with my experience, training and education allows me to approach my work with intense focus, attention to detail and a deep understanding of the emotional and technical nuances that make music and sound impactful. My creative approach is adaptive and tailored to your needs, using my skills to help you achieve your vision. 

I am committed to creating inclusive and welcoming working relationships, actively opposing racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and all forms of ableism. I choose to collaborate only with those who share these values and stand firmly against working with bigots of any kind.

Thanks for listening and have a good day.",,,1,https://v.redd.it/6qybcerclzid1,/r/Filmmakers/comments/1etjm4k/versatile_composer_seeking_paid_work_so_i_can/
Could you take 90 seconds and roast my reel?,"This is my latest film & video production showreel/sizzle reel. I haven’t posted it publicly yet besides Vimeo, but am trying to take an “only the best shots” approach. I’d love any any all feedback/tips/advice!",2024-08-16 08:12:42,ThrowRAIdiotMaestro,2,False,"I can't roast this, sorry. Your shot composition is nearly perfect, and you have a very firm understanding of how to use high contrast light values and colors. Solid stuff.","You appear to have a brief shot of Wentworth Miller, he's a known actor I would have that nearer the start..and longer.","At 37 seconds you can spot film equipment in the shot! Jeez don’t you know that breaks the 4th wall? And whats with the run time? Its 93 seconds so your claim of 90 seconds constitutes illegal false advertising. I’ve contacted my attorney. Also I noticed sometimes people move their lips but I can’t hear them. What do you think I’m some kind of lip reader? You need to fire your sound crew for not turning on the microphone. Honestly I’m surprised you would post this on Vimeo, everyone knows TikTok aspect ratio and short form length is the future of cinema!",3,https://vimeo.com/nerris/reel,/r/Filmmakers/comments/1etja6c/could_you_take_90_seconds_and_roast_my_reel/
Should I make two versions of my short film?,"For some context- essentially every video I’ve ever put out (probably 45ish now) on both YouTube and instagram, contains copyrighted music. 

Seeing as I’ve never attempted to monetize my videos, I have never run into an issue with copyright. 

However for a larger, upcoming passion project I have been considering submitting to festivals and therefore would obviously require actual licensing to use preexisting music to submit legally.

The thing is royalty free music is really just not that great, and I already have music in mind that i think fits the aesthetic and story of the film very well.

Taking both of these things into account, I have been considering creating two versions of my film- one with ‘actual’ music that I can upload to YouTube as a sort of “true” version, and another with copyright free music that I can submit to festivals without running into legal issues.

Two questions: 1. Will I run into issues with festivals due to there being a version out there that DOES contain unlicensed copyrighted music? And 2. Is this a good idea in the first place?

I just want to make the film the way I envision it, and there are some songs that just don’t have royalty free alternatives, while also being able to know that when I get rejected it won’t be because I chose a song I didn’t have the rights to.

This is about being able to possibly further my career without sacrificing the quality of the art.",2024-08-16 07:37:04,Nodoe_,0,False,"Festivals aren't going to accept films that are already online and available to watch. 

Find a composer and avoid copyrighted music. It's going to waste your time making two films.",,,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1etirq0/should_i_make_two_versions_of_my_short_film/,/r/Filmmakers/comments/1etirq0/should_i_make_two_versions_of_my_short_film/

Amateur Starter,"Very sorry but I'm struggling to find an answer to this as I go through the various reddits associated with this topic. I am an aspiring amateur filmmaker. I understand this seems to be a much more professional realm but I was hoping I could get some answers here. As this is mostly a hobby for me and really only for myself, I am not looking for top of the line production.

My plan was to use my smartphone to film and an external microphone, possibly a cheap sennheiser or robe micro. I was curious if anyone knew what the current meta is for budget filming here? I can't afford much, but I know sound is something I want to get absolutely right. If there's a good stand for my phone and a Robe Videomicro II works well enough for my aspirations then I'd like to know I am at least heading in the right direction. I also have no idea what lighting I should look for

My goal is to start making some films now and expanding on my inventory when I can. Thank you so much to whomever can help me",2024-08-16 05:26:17,JeebusMcFunk,0,False,"Best gear is the gear you have. Especially if you’re just starting out, don’t let those concerns stop you.

I'm having a pretty rough go at it lately.,"- Freelance clients are really beginning to dry up.
- I cannot seem to get a videographer / editor job at a company because I'm simultaneously overqualified and not the right fit. (300 applications now)
- I feel like my work looks old somehow.
- I infact am getting old.
- I feel like I had a little talent at one point and now I'm just stupid and my brains all fucked up.
- I'm kind of losing my love for the game.
- Everything just feels like it's meant for social media.

I keep sitting down to write at night and I can only do a page or two in an hour before just feeling exhausted. And it's just nonsense with no form or real purpose. It's just the same grade school slop, thugs with guns shit I was writing 15 years ago.

I need some serious advice/direction right now because I'm probably going to be broke and homeless in 6 months.

It’s still there.  Keep nurturing it, be true to yourself, and things will come around. Maybe not tomorrow but they will come around.","It’s time to disconnect your income from your art/passion. The money side is sucking the creative side dry.

If the filmmaking passion is truly a passion, you’ll feel the flame begin to burn hotter as you get your feet under you with a different job.

Strategies for transitioning to more creative work,"Hey filmmakers! I’m transitioning from corporate work to story-driven projects and aiming to become a DOP. 

Here’s where I am stuck:

**Finding clients:** My past work is decent but not mind blowing (yet). I’m working on building a strong showreel and finding mid-to-high-end clients. 

What industries or niches do you think have more opportunities for mid/high-end work?

How would you find and connect with clients who care more about quality than just the price? 

**Budget/Pricing:** How do you justify higher rates and negotiate with budget-conscious clients?

**Showreel/Collab:** What projects or collaborations boosted your profile?

Love to hear your thoughts!

You could post or dm answers :)

"How can I most maximize a couple of short documentaries?
","So I've wrapped one, and about to wrap a second short documentary (10-20 minutes). I kind of filmed them on a lark... the stories and characters landed in my lap so I went with it. I just watched the rough cut for the 1st one and... It's good! I was worried that that we didn't get enough and that it was surface level but... It's good! Shot by a great DP, edited by a great editor about an interesting subject. A couple more drafts and I think it'll be a solid little film.

I will say neither one of them redefines documentary forms, really what attracted me to both stories was how I predicted they would play out as basically classic 3 act genre movies... and they more or less did.

I really just made these films because I didn't want the opportunity to pass me by with the characters/events, my plan was to film them, plow them into a couple of local festivals and then have them as part of my portfolio, because I would really like to keep making small little docs like these. But are there any other ways I can sort of maximize them?",2024-08-16 00:27:49,Egans721,3,False,"Congrats on wrapping your short docs! Since you're aiming to enter festivals and build a portfolio, you might want to create some engaging shorts to promote them on social media.
