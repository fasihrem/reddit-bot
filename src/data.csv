All we want is a proper Internet connection ,"It's a shame for concerned authorities that even in 2024, we're crying for basic things like a proper Internet.
We're bringing revenue in the country and paying I don't even remember how many taxes & in return all we ask for a proper Internet connection.. 

No reduction in taxes
No digital institutions 
No proper electricity

"Men that got rejected for rishtas,what was the reason?","Let's Talk about Rishta Rejections for Men

We often hear stories about women being rejected for various reasons when it comes to arranged marriages or even relationships. Let's share our experiences to understand the different perspectives.

Why was a rishta rejected?

Was it an arranged marriage or a relationship?",2024-08-13 08:32:47,Working_Emphasis_271,132,False,Friend's half Chinese. He got rejected because the girl's family didn't want Chinese babies. He ended up marrying a beautiful girl outside of their Punjabi circle. Kismet.,"I was not of their qoum, bro... I was not of their qoum...","not ""pretty"" enough.  
happened to myself.

following were the other I got rejected.

* Hometown is a village (about 5x), though I've been living in city since 16 years,
* No car (about 3x), which I planned to buy before marriage (and did that) , NOT wanted people to judge me on that .
* No house in Lahore city (around 6x), Yes, it my fault I was 27 and didn't own any >1Cr house because I wasted all that money partying. /s
* And many times couldn't even figure out the reason, there was just no contact even after meeting.

I was earning 250k at that time.  
Now on some months I have made 18lac/month, since I shifted to freelancing and working directly with clients.  
I'm happy the my current in-laws are the ones who NEVER even asked me any question regarding my finances, not even before marriage. And my wife IS THE ONE who deserves everything for that.

  
Edit: Oh, I was rejected because not owning Car? I now have a modified swift with 1.8 engine. Go figure.  
This whole rishta process is f'd up. People have so many unrealistic expectations of the guy. On the other hand if someone with no earnings/no work experience/ no ethics is just living in a owned house with joint family system, which was bought by their great grandfather, but INSIDE THE CITY, they would happily sell their daughter to that, but if you are someone who came from a village, doesn't matter how much have you struggled, what name have you made for yourself, what is your future potential.  
NAH, there'd be no F given to that by girl's parents.

And there was NO JAHAIZ, I never wanted it, made it clear to everyone, there was no points for that too.

Vietnam Advising Against Travel to Pakistan â€“ Thoughts?,"So I recently had a conversation after a long time with a very old Vietnamese friend whom I met in a video game mentioned that the Vietnamese government is discouraging travel to Pakistan.

Not a necessary debate right now but i think this is the job of a political analyst and social critique. This is what he does.

Misinformation in the name of Religion,"This is very annoying to watch, people using religion and calling Pakistan the creation of Britain, saying that we, as Muslims, cannot believe in Nationalist flags, and have only one flag. The independence day of our nation is tomorrow, and there will be people like this around, especially like it was in the Britain last year.

Most of the people he's talking to would probably feel bad about waving him off because he starts off by talking about Islamic flags, so they would feel bad or fear for themselves due to the dogma attached to religion. But please, respect your history and the sacrifices put into this nation, and tell these people to leave you alone, don't entertain them.

In regards to the video, there is so much misinformation in regards to history. 

1. He says that Pakistan, Palestinian flags are a creation of the Britain. Fact actually is that the Palestinian flag, like the flags of a lot of the other Arab nations, represents the four major Arab empires (Ummayads, Abbasids, Fatimids, and Hashemites), they all had flat color flags, the Arab flags use all four colors which is why you see them so commonly in their flags, it's representative of their history. Pakistan's flag, everyone here knows who it was designed by. The influence of the crescent and the star comes from the Ottoman flag at the time, while the color green comes from the fact that the two major long lasting Islamic Empires in the subcontinent (Mughals and Delhi Sultunate) had a large green background to them in many of their variations, and also the fact that green was by extension of movements representative of Islam and Muslims.

2. He talks about the Spaniards using an Islamic flag in their Independence ritual, which I don't even know why that was relevant (???), is trying to score points or what? Like, wow, the whites use an Islamic flag in their independence even, therefore, we should abandon all our flags and only use this one. What he didn't mention is context, which might make you feel uneasy to the fact that he brought it up even. The Spaniards do indeed carry an Islamic flag during their Independence ceremony, it is an Islamic battle flag which was carried by the Andalusian Muslims, particularly in a major battle against Christendom which actually marked the ending of Muslim rule in Andalusia, and the successful beginning of the Reconquesta by Christendom. That battle flag was captured by them in that battle, so it's a historical relic, which signifies a major point in the end of Islamic rule, and in the timeline of Reconquesta. So you can say they're really parading the flag.

I won't go into details about nationalism and that debate, but it's so annoying how some people shill the idea of this 'global community' when so many of one half of it wouldn't even view the other half as equals, and we have seen how this has worked out in recent years. To top it off, they will put down their own nation, and only real identity, calling it a foreign creation (a bit ironic? No?) to shill for the idea of this 'global community.'
